# Computing tips

## Running jobs in the background
* Running jobs in the background with `screen`. [Anyone add some links or texts?]

## IDE: PyCharm, VS Code, and Jupyter lab

## Huang lab notes
* See [PBS.md](https://github.com/StatBiomed/YHLab-guide/blob/master/PBS.md) for submitting tasks to PBS system and using conda with PBS. 
* See [plotting.md](https://github.com/StatBiomed/HuangLab-onboarding/tree/master/plotting.md) for tips on plotting with publication standard.

## Linux useful commands
* Downloading large files from clouds (Google Drive, OneDrive) or data repositories with [wget](https://github.com/huangyh09/codingnotes/blob/master/wget_cloud.md)
* `ctrl + Z`, followed by `kill %%` to kill previous job [add links?]

## Conda environment directory
* Change the configuration setting
* Add jupyter kernel with `ipykernel`

## SRA/fastq at EBI database
* Ruiyan add more links 

## Misc
* Python module auto reload [links ?]
* Using VS Codes on cluster ([Weizhong's note](https://dirt-fig-392.notion.site/Using-vscode-on-a-high-performance-cluster-400ddd3549b340ce9041f14c8616be9a?pvs=4)) and Jupyter on cluser ([jupyte tips](https://github.com/StatBiomed/sbms-server/blob/master/Jupyterlab.md#using-jupyter-on-computing-node-of-a-cluster))
* Excel Table to Latex table (google sheet adds-on, or using R)
